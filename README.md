**INF101 OOP Wordle Project**

**About The Project**
This repository is part of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course (INF101) at the University of Bergen (UIB). It features a Java-based implementation of the Wordle game, designed to help students apply and understand various OOP principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

**Built With**
- Java


**How to Play**
The game simulates the popular Wordle game where players have a limited number of attempts to guess a hidden word. Each guess must be a valid word, and after each guess, the colors of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- Green: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- Yellow: The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
- Grey: The letter is not in the word.


**To play the game**
- Enter your guess and press enter.
- Use the feedback from each guess to make further guesses.
- You have six attempts to guess the right word.


**Gameplay Tips**
- Start with a broad vocabulary to maximize letter discovery.
- Pay attention to the feedback provided by the tile colors to guide your next guesses.


**Choose your own word**
The project includes a choose your own word button. This can be used to play against friends, and have them give you a word youÂ´re going to guess. Notice that the word has to be in the english dictionairy and be the correct length.
